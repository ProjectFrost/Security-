Starting Domain 3

# SECURE PROTOCOLS
# # Voice and video

 - SRTP(Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol)
	 Adds security features to RTP(Keeps conversations private)
	 For encryption, uses AES
	 Authentication, Integrity and replay protection with the use of HMAC-SHA1 hashes
# # Time synchronization
- NTPSec
	NTP doesnt have security features
	 NTPSec adds those

# # Email
- S/MIME(Secure Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)
	Publick key encyption and digital signing of mail contents

- Secure POP and secure IMAP
	Use of STARTTLS extension to encrypt POP3 with SSL or use IMAP with SSL

# # IPSec
Security for OSI Layer 3(Network)
Encryption and packet signing
TWO CORE IPSEC PROTOCOLS
- Authentication headers (AH) → Integrity/Authentication
- Encapsulation Security Payload (ESP) → Encryption
# # File transfer
- FTPS
	FTP over SSL (FTP-SSL)
	- IS NOT SFTP
- SFTP
	FTP over  SSH
# # LDAP(Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
- LDAPS(LDAP Secure)
	LDAP over SSL. Non standard
- SASL(Simple Authentication Secure Layer)
	Authentication using multiple methods. LDAP uses it
# # SSH(Secure Shell)
- Replaces Telnet. Encrypted terminal communication
# # Domain name resolution
- DNSSEC
	Domain Name Security Extensions. Validates DNS responses
	Public key cryptography
# # Routing and switches
- SNMPv3(Simple Network Management Protocol)
	Confidentiality
	Integrity
	Authentication
# # Network address allocation
- There is no “secure” DHCP
- In Active Directory, DHCP servers must be authorized
- Some switches can be configure dto nly allow “trusted” devices. Cisco calls it DHCP Snooping
- Can be configured to limit  the number of MAC addresses per interface

# Endpoint Protections

# # EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)
Detect a threat not only through signatures, but using behavioral analysis, machine learning, process monitoring. Relatively lightweight on the user. Can also investigate the threat and is API driven, not user or technician intervention required.

# # DLP (Data Loss Prevention)
Stop the data before the attacker gets it. Often requires multiple solutions

# # NGFW(Next-gen firewall)
Also called stateful firewalls, deep packet inspection,..
- Allow or disallow application features
- Identify attacks and malware
- Examine encrypted data
- Prevent access to URLs or URL categories
# # Host-Based firewall
Allow or disallow incoming or outgoing application traffic. Common to manage them centrally

# # Finding intrusions
- HIDS(Host-based Intrusion Detection System)
