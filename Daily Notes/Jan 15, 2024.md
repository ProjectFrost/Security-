Starting Domain 3

# SECURE PROTOCOLS
# # Voice and video

 - SRTP(Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol)
	 Adds security features to RTP(Keeps conversations private)
	 For encryption, uses AES
	 Authentication, Integrity and replay protection with the use of HMAC-SHA1 hashes
# # Time synchronization
- NTPSec
	NTP doesnt have security features
	 NTPSec adds those

# # Email
- S/MIME(Secure Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)
	Publick key encyption and digital signing of mail contents

- Secure POP and secure IMAP
	Use of STARTTLS extension to encrypt POP3 with SSL or use IMAP with SSL

# # IPSec
Security for OSI Layer 3(Network)
Encryption and packet signing
TWO CORE IPSEC PROTOCOLS
- Authentication headers (AH) → Integrity/Authentication
- Encapsulation Security Payload (ESP) → Encryption
# # File transfer
- FTPS
	FTP over SSL (FTP-SSL)
	- IS NOT SFTP
- SFTP
	FTP over  SSH
# # LDAP(Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
- LDAPS(LDAP Secure)
	LDAP over SSL. Non standard
- SASL(Simple Authentication Secure Layer)
	Authentication using multiple methods. LDAP uses it
# # SSH(Secure Shell)
- Replaces Telnet. Encrypted terminal communication
# # Domain name resolution
- DNSSEC
	Domain Name Security Extensions. Validates DNS responses
	Public key cryptography
# # Routing and switches
- SNMPv3(Simple Network Management Protocol)
	Confidentiality
	Integrity
	Authentication
# # Network address allocation
- There is no “secure” DHCP
- In Active Directory, DHCP servers must be authorized
- Some switches can be configure dto nly allow “trusted” devices. Cisco calls it DHCP Snooping
- Can be configured to limit  the number of MAC addresses per interface

# Endpoint Protections

# # EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)
Detect a threat not only through signatures, but using behavioral analysis, machine learning, proce
