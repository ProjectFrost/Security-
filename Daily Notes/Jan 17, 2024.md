# Boot integrity

Secure Boot → Trusted Boot → Measured Boot

# # UEFI BIOS Secure Boot

- BIOS includes the manufacturer’s public key
- Digital signature checked during  BIOS update
- Prevents unauthorized writes to the flash
- Secure Boot verifies the bootloader that must be signed with a trusted certificate or manually approved the digital certificate.
# # Trusted Boot
- Bootloader verifies the OS kernel. A  corrupted kernel will stop the process
- The kernel verifies all of the other startup components and before loading the drivers, ELAM(Early Launch Anti-Malware) starts.
# # Measured Boot
- UEFI stores a hash of the firmware, boot drivers and everything else loaded during Secure Boot and Trusted Boot process. Stored in the TPM 
- REMOTE ATTESTATION: Device provides an operational report to a verification server. Encrypted and digitally signed. Attestation server identifies and manages the changes.
