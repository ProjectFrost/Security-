# Load Balancing

- TCP/SSL offload
- Caching
- Prioritization
- Content Switching

# # Scheduling
- Round-Robin
- Weighted round-robin
- Dynamic round-robin → Monitor and distribute to the freest server 
- Active/Active load balancing → All servers active
- Affinity → Same request to same server the user has already used
- Active/passive load balancing → Some servers active, others are on standby
# Network Segmentation

## Physical
- Devices are physically separate (air gap)
- Must be connected to provide communication
## Logical
- VLANs → Cannot without a Layer 3 device / router
## Virtual

Zero Trust → Everything must be verified

# VPNs
Encrypted data traversing a public network
Concentrator → Encryption/decryption access device.Often integrated into a firewall
## SSL VPN
- Uses port tcp/443
- No big VPN clients
- Authenticate users means no neeed for digital certificates or shared passwords
- Can be run from browser or light client
## HTML5
- Create a VPN tunnel without need for a separate VPN application
## Modes
- Full tunnel
	All communications go through the VPN concentrator
- Split tunnel
	Some information can go outside the tunnel, some go to the VPN concetrator
- Site to Site
	Communication between two different VPNs. Almost always on. Firewalls often act as VPN  concentrators
- L2TP
	Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol. Connecting sites over a layer 3 network as if they were connected at layer 2. Commonly used with IPSec (L2TP for tunnel, IPSec for encryption)
- IPSec
	Security for layer 3
	Transport mode → IP header added at front and encrypt the data. Doesnt protect IP
	Tunnel mode → Both IP and data encrypted
	Authentication header → Hash of the packet and a shared key
	ESP → Where transport and tunnel mode are used. Adds a header, a traile and an Integrity Check Value
# Port security
It refers to the physical side of port security

- Broadcast storm control
	Limit number of broadcasts per second
	Can often be used to contol multicast and unknown unicast traffic
	Manage by specific values or percentage
- Loop protection
	STP(Spanning tree protocol)
