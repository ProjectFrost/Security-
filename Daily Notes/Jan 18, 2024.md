# Load Balancing

- TCP/SSL offload
- Caching
- Prioritization
- Content Switching

- Round-Robin
- Weighted round-robin
- Dynamic round-robin → Monitor and distribute to the freest server 
- Active/Active load balancing → All servers active
- Affinity → Same request to same server the user has already used
- Active/passive load balancing → Some servers active, others are on standby
# Network Segmentation

## Physical
- Devices are physically separate (air gap)
- Must be connected to provide communication
## Logical
- VLANs → Cannot without a Layer 3 device / router
## Virtual
