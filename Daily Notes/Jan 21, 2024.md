# Mobile Networks

## Bluetooth Networks
Sometimes refered as a PAN(Personal Area Network)

## RFID(Radio-Frequency identificaion)
Anything that needs to be tracked. Use Radar technology to transmit energy to the tag, ID is transmitted back. Some tag format can be active/powered

## NFC(Near field communication)
Builds on RFID. Usually used on payment systems, helps with Bluetooth pairing, access token

Is possible to capture remotely, jam the signal, relay/replay attack, stole/lost phone

## IR(Infrared)

## Context-aware authentication
- Combine multiple contexts, where you login, where you normally frequent, other devices,…
## Containerization
- Separate enterprise mobile apps and data
	Create a virtual “container” for company data
	Refers to mobile device storage segmentation(not something like Kubernetes on PC)
## FDE(Full Device Encryption)

## WiFi Direct/ ad hoc
Connect wireless devices directly, without an access point
Wi-FI Direct simplifies the process. Common to see in home devices

## Hotspot/tethering
Turn your phone into a Wi-Fi hotspot. Dependent on phone type and provider. May provide inadvertent access to an internal network

## Payment methods
Bypassing primary authentication would allow payment.

# Mobile Deployment
- BYOD (Bring Your Own Device)
	Employee owns the device
	Difficult to secure

- COPE(Corporate Owned Personally Enabled
	Company buys the device, used as both a corporate device and a personal device
	Organization keeps full control of the device
	Information is protected using corporate policies
	Similar to COPE is CYOD(Choose Your Own Device) → You get to decide which device you are going to use and company buys it for you
- Corporate-owned
	Company owns the device. Not for personal use. Very specific security requirements
- VDI/VMI
	The apps are separated from the mobile device, the data as well
	Data is stored securely, centralized
	Works really well for application development

# Cloud Security Controls
# HA across zones
- Availability zones (AZ)
	Isolated locations withing a cloud region (geographical location)
	AZ commonly spans across multiple region
	Each AZ has independent power,HVAC, and networking
	Use load balancers to provide seamless HA
## Resource policies
- Identity and access management (IAM)
	Who gets access
	What they get access to
- Map job functions to roles
- Provide access to cloud resources
- Centralize user accounts
## Secrets management
- Authorize access to the secrets
- Manage an access control policy → Limit users to only necessary secrets
- Provide an audit trail
## Integration and auditing
- Integrate security across multiple platform
- Consolidate log storage and reporting → Cloud based SIEM
- Auditing

# Securing Cloud Storage
## Permissions
- IAM
- Bucket policies
- Globally blocking
## Encryption
- Servr-side → Encrypt in the cloud, data is encrypted when stored on disk
- Client-side → Data is already encrypted, perfomed by application
- *KEY MANAGEMENT IS CRITICAL*
## Replication
- Disaster recovery, high availability
- Data analysis
- Backups
# Securing Cloud Networks
## Public and private subnets
- Private cloud → All internal IP addresses. Connect over a VPN
- Public cloud → External Ip addresses. Connect from anywhere
- Hybrid cloud → Combine both

## Segmentation
Cloud contains separate VPCs, containers, and microservices. Thorugh a WAF, NGFW,…
## API inspection and integration
- APU monitoring
	View specific API queries
## Compute cloud instances
This is the IaaS component for the cloud computing environment
- EC2 (Amazon)
- Google Compute Engine (GCE)
- Azure VMs

## Security Groups
- A firewall for compute instances
- Layer 4 port number → TCP or UDP port
- Layer 3 address → Individual addresses, CIDR block notation, IPV4 or IPV6
## Dynamic resource allocation
- Scale up and down
	Rapid elasticity
- Ongoing monitoring
## Instance awareness
- Identify and manage very specific data flows
- Each instance of a data flow is different
- Define and set policies
## Virtual private cloud endpoints
- VPC gateway endpoints
	Allow private cloud subnets to communicate to other cloud services
- Keep private resources private
## Container security
- Use container-specific operating systems
- Group container types on the same host
	Same purpose sensitivity and threat posture
	Limit the type of any intrusion

# Cloud Security Solutions
## Cloud Security Security Broker (CASB)
- Implemented as client software, local security appliances or cloud-based security solutions
-  Visibility
	Determine what apps are in use
- Compliance
	Are users complying with regulations
- Threat prevention
	Allow access by authorized users , prevent attacks
- Data security
	Ensure that all data transfers are encrypted. DLP

## Application security

## Firewalls in the cloud
Usually Virtual firewalls. 
- Segmentation
- OSI layers
	Layer 4 (TCP/UDP), Layer 7 (Application)

## Security controls
- Cloud-native security controls
	Integrated and supported by the cloud provider
	Many configuration options
	Security is part of the infrastructure
- Third-party solutions
	Extend options apart from whats in the contract with the cloud providers

# Identity Controls

## Identity Provider
- You can think of it a Authentication as a Service
- A list of entities
- Commonly used by SSO applications or an authentication proccess
- Uses standard authentication methods
## Attributes
An identifier or property of an entity. Personal, Other, We can one or more attributes for identification

## Certificates
- Digital certificates
- Binds the identity of the certificate owner to a public and private key
- Requires an existing public-key infrastructure
	CA → trusted entity
	The CA digitally signs the certificates
## Tokens and cards
- Smart card
- USB token
## SSH keys
- Use a key instead of username and password
	Critical for automation
- Key management is critical
	Centralize, control and audit key use
- SSH key managers

# Account Types
- User accounts
	An account on a computer associated with a specific person
	Storage and files can be private to that user
	No privileged access to the operating system
- Shared account and generic accounts
	Very difficult to create an audit trail and determine proper privileges
	Password management becomes difficult
	Dont use shared or generic accounts is best practice
- Guest accounts
	Access to a computer for guests
	Access to the userspace is one step closer to an exploit
	Must be controlled. Shouldnt be the default account
- Service accounts
	Used exclusively by services running on a computer
	Access can be defined for a specific service
	Commonly use usernames and passwords (Need to determine the best policy for them)
- Privileged accounts
	Elevated access to one or more systems
	Complete access to the system
	This account should not be used for normal administration
	Needs to be highly secured


# Account Policies
- Perform routine audits
- Auditing
	- Permission auditing
	- Usage auditing

- Password complexity and length
	- Increase Password entropy
	- Stronger password are at least 8 characters
	- Prevent password reuse

- Account lockout and disablement
- Location-based policies
	- Network location
	- Geolocation
	- Geofencing
	- Geotagging
	- Combined them together for location-based access rules
	- Time-based access rules

# Authentication Management
- Password vaults
- TPM
- HSM
- KBA (Knowledge-based authentication)
	- Static KBA → Pre-configured shared secrets
	- Dynamic KBA → Questions are based on a identity verification service


# PAP and CHAP

## PAP (Password Authentication Protocol)
- A basic authentication method
- PAP is in the clear

## CHAP (Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol)
- Three-way handshake 
	Server sends a challenge message, client responds with a password hash calculated from the challenge and the password , server compares received hash with stored hash
- MS-CHAP v2→ Microsoft implementation of CHAP, very weak cause of utilization of DES that can be brute forced relatively quickly

# Identity and access services

## RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service)
One of the most common AAA services. Centralizes authentication for users.

## TACACS (Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System)
- TACACS+ → Latest version of TACACS, not backwards compatible

## Kerberos
- Network authentication protocol
	Authenticate once, trusted by the system
	Both sides authenticate, client and server
- SSO with Kerberos
	Authenticate one time with the use of Cryptographic tickets
	Only works with Kerberos

## IEEE 802.1X
- Port based Network Access Control (NAC)
- EAP integrates with 802.1X
- Used in conjunction with an access database (RADIUS,LDAP,TACACS+,…)

# Federated identities
- SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)
	Open standard for authentication and authorization for third parties
	Not originally designed for mobile apps
- OAuth
	Authorization framework, what types of resources a user will be able to access
	OpenID handles the SSO authentication, OAuth the authorization


# Access Control
- MAC(Mandatory Access Control)
	The operating system limits the operation on an object, based on security clearance levels
	Every object gets a label (Confidential, secret, top secret, etc)
	Labeling of objects uses predefined rules, the admin decideds who gets access to what security level, users cannot change their clearance level
- DAC (Discretionary Access Control)
	User decides permissions and who has access to the objects
	Really flexible, really weak security
- RBAC(Role-based access control)
	Administrators provide access based on the role of the user
	In Windows, use Groups to provide role-based access control
- ABAC (Attribute-based Access Control)
	Users can have complex relationships to applications and data
	ABAC can consider many parameters
	Combine and evaluate multiple parameters
- Rule-based access control
	Access is determined through system-enforced rules. Rules are associated with the object


- File system security
	ACLs
	Groups/user rights and permission
	Encryption can be built-in

## Conditional access
- Conditions
- Once we know the conditions we can apply controls
- Common on cloud based access

## Privileged access management (PAM)
- Managing superuser access
- Store privileged accounts in a digital vault
- PAM advantages
	Centralized passwiord management
	Enables automation
	Manage access for each individual user
	Extensive tracking and audit

# PKI
Policies, procedures, hardware, software and people

## Key lifecycle
Key generation → Certificate generation → Distribution → Storage → Revocation → Expiration

## Digital certificates
- A public key certificate → Binds a public key with a digital signature
- Adds trust → The CA signs the certificate so others trust it
- Certificate creation can be built into the OS
## Commercial certficate authorities
- Built-in to your browser
- Purchase your web site certificate
- Create a key pair, send the public key to the CA to be signed
	A certificate signing request (CSR)
- May provide different levels of trust and additional features
## Private CA
- You are your own CA
- Needed for medium-to-large organizations
- Implement as part of your overall computing strategy
## PKI trust relationships
- Single CA
- Hierarchical
## Registration Authority (RA)
- The entity requesting the certificate needs to be verified
	The RA identifies and authenticates the requester
- Approval or rejection
- Also responsible for revocations
- Manages renewals and re-key requests
