## RFID(Radio-Frequency identificaion)
Anything that needs to be tracked. Use Radar technology to transmit energy to the tag, ID is transmitted back. Some tag format can be active/powered

## NFC(Near field communication)
Builds on RFID. Usually used on payment systems, helps with Bluetooth pairing, access token

Is possible to capture remotely, jam the signal, relay/replay attack, stole/lost phone

## IR(Infrared)
Control your entertainment center. File transfers are possible, other phones can control it

## USB (Universal Serial Bus)
Physical connectivity to your mobile device

## GPS
Precise navigation. Determines location ased on timing differences. Need to see at least 4 satellites

# Mobile Device Management
Centralized management of the mobile devices.

## Application management
Manage application use through *allow lists*. 
## Content management

## Context-aware authentication
- Combine multiple contexts, where you login, where you normally frequent, other devices,…
## Containerization
- Separate enterprise mobile apps and data
	Create a virtual “container” for company data
	Refers to mobile device storage segmentation(not something like Kubernetes on PC)
## FDE(Full Device Encryption)
- Scramble all of the data on the mobile device
- There is no recovery, often encryption key is backed on the MDM

# Mobile device security

## MicroSD HSM
An HSM designed for mobile devices

## Unified Endpoint Management (UEM)
