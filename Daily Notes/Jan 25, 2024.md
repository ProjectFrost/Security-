- Add entries to the system log
Example: logger “Thi information is added to syslog”
Useful for including information in a local or remote syslog file


# Packet Tools
## Tcpreplay
Replay and edit packet captures
Test security devices
Send hundreds of thousands of traffic flows per second

# Forensic Tools
## dd
Create a bit by bit copy of a drive
dd if=/dev/sda of=/tmp/sda-image.img → Create a disk image
dd if=/tmp/sda-image.img of=/dev/sda → Restore an image

## memdump
Copy information in system memory to the standard output stream
Copy to another host across the network

## WinHex
A universal hexadecimal editor
Edit disk, files, RAM
Disk cloning
Secure wipe

## FTK imager
AccessData forensic drive imaging tool → Include file utilities and read-only image mounting
Windows executable
Read encrypted drives (provided with the password)
Can also import other image formats

## Autopsy
Perform digital forensics of hard drives, smartphones

## Data sanitization
Remove completely

# Incident Respond Process

## Roles
Incident response team
IT security management
Compliance officers
Technical staff
User community

## NIST SP800-61
Computer Security Incident Handling Guide
Lifecycle of the incident
Preparation → Detection and Analysis → Containment, Erradication and Recovery → Post incident activity

## Preparation
Comm methods
Incident handling hardware and software
Incident analysis resources
Incident mitigation software
Policies needed for incident handling

Detection
Incident precursors → Web server log, Exploit announcement, Direct threats
Incident indicators → Buffer overflow attempt, Anti-virus software, Host-based monitor detects a configuration change, network traffic flows deviate

## Isolation and containtment
Sandbox
Some malware can check if they are on a sandbox

## Recovery after an incident
Erradicate the bug
Recover the system

## Reconstitution
Recovery may take months
Strat with quick- high value, Later phases involve much “heavier lifting”


# Incident Response Planning

## Exercise
Test before an actual event
Use well-defined rules of engagement
Very specific scenario
Evalute response


## Tabletop exercises
Logistical analysis
Talk through a simulated disaster

## Walkthrough
Include responders
Test processes and procedures before an event
Identifies actual faults or missing steps

## Simulation
Test with a simulated  event

## Stakeholder management
Keeping a good ongoing relationship with customer of IT
Most of this happens prior to an incident
Continues after the incident


## Disaster recovery plan
A comprehensive plan on what the hell to do if a disaster happens

## COOP(Continuity of Operation Planning)
Alternative when things dont work, like manual transactions, paper receipts,… Must be documented and tested before an event occurs

## Incident response team
