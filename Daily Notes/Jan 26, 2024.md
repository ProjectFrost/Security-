# Log Management

## Syslog
- Standard for message logging
- Usually a central logging receiver
- Each log entry is labeled
- Sylog daemon oprtion → Rsyslog, syslog-ng, NXLog

## Journalctl
- System log are stored in a binary format
- Provides a method for querying logs

## Bandwidth monitors
Percentage of network use over time
- SNMP, NetFlow, sFlow, …
Identify fundamental issues

## NetFlow
Gather traffic statistics from all traffic flows
- Probe and collector → Probe watches netwrok comms summary records are sent to the collector
- Usually a separate reporting app
## IPFIX
Like a newer version of NetFlow
- You can customize the kind of data you want to collect
## sFlow 
Only a portion of the actual network traffic
Usually embedded in the infrastructure, relatively accurate statistics

## Protocol analyzer output
Wireshark

# Endpoint Security Configuration

## Whitelists/Blacklists

# Digital Forensics
RFC 3227 → A good set of best practices
Acquisition → Analysis → Reporting

## Legal hold
Hold notification → Custodians are instructed to preserve data
Separate repository for  electronically stored information (ESI)

## Capture video
Captures the status of the screen and other volatile information

## Admissibility
Legal authorization
Procedures and tools
Laboratories
Technical and academic qualifications

## Chain of custody
Control evidence
Everyone who contacts the evidence
Label and catalog everything → Digitally tag all items for ongoing documentation

## Recording time offsets
## Event logs
- System logs → Documents imprortant os and application events
- Export and store for future reference
## Interviews
## Reports
Document the findings
Summary information
Detailed explanation of data acquisition
The findings
Conclusion

# Forensics data acquisition
## Disk
- Copy everything on a storage drive
- Drive image preparation → Power down to prevent changes, Remove storage drive
- Connect to imaging device with write-protection
- Forensic clone → Bit by bit copy
## RAM
- A difficult target to capture
- Memory dump → Grab everything in active RAM
- Important data
## Swap/pagefile
A place to store RAM when memory is depleted
Can also contain portions of an application
Contains data similar to a RAM dump

## Operating system
- Core operating system
- Other OS data (logged in users, open ports , …)
## Device
Mobile devices and tablets
- Capture data → Use a backup or transfer image over USB
- Data 
## Firmware
Specific to the platform
Attacker gains access to the device
Data discovery (Exploit data, firmware function, Real-time data)

## Snapshot
Original image is the full backup
Each snaphot is incremented from the last

## Cache
Store data for use later
- Can contain specialized data
- Some data may never be used

## Network
Gather information about and from the network
- Inbound and outbound sessions
- Packet data
- Third-party packet captures
## Artifacts
Digital items left behind

# On premises vs On cloud Forensics

## Right-to-audit clauses
Data sharing and outsourcing agreement
Cloud computing providers
Right-to-audit should be in the contract

## Regulatory/jurisdiction
Forensics professionals must know their legal rights
Data stored in cloud may not be located in the same country
Location of the data is critical

## Data breach notification laws
A lot of places force to disclose data breaches
Vary widely across countries and localities. If you are in the cloud you are a global entity
Notification requirements also vary

# Managing evidence

## Integrity
- Hashing
- Checksums
- Provenance → Documentation of authenticity, Blockchain technology
## Preservation
- Manage the collection process → Work from copies
- Live collection has become an important skill → Data may be encrypted or difficult to collect after powering down
- Follow best practices to ensure admissibility

## E-discovery
Gathers data required by the legal process
Works together with digital forensics

## Data recovery
Extract missing data without affecting the integrity of the data

## Non-repudiation
Proof of data integrity and the origin of the data
Authentication that is gen
