# Personnel security
- AUP (Acceptable use policies)
	What is acceptable use of companuy assets
	Used by an org to limit legal liability
- Business policies
	Job rotation
	Mandatory vacations

	Detailed documentation and records

# Third-party Risk Management
- SLA (Service Level Agreement)
	Minimum terms for services provided
	Common between customers and service providers
- Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
	Both sides agree on the contents of the memorandum
	Usually includes statements of confidentiality
	Not a signed contract
- Measurement system analysis (MSA)
	Used with quality management systems
	Assess the measurement process
- BPA (Business Partnership Agreement)
- NDA
	Confidentiality between parties
	Can be unilateral or bilateral
	Formal contract
- EOL (End of life)
	Manufacturer stops selling a product, may continues supporting the product
- EOSL 
	Support is no longer available for the product


# Organizational changes
- Change control → Detemine scope, Analyze the risk, create a plan, get end-user approval, present the proposal to the change control board, have a backout plan if the change doesn’t work, document the changes
- Asset management → Identify and track computing assets, respond faster to security problem, both hardware and data, Track licenses, Verify that all devices are up to date

# Risk Management Types

## Strategies
- Acceptance
- Risk-avoidance
- Transference → buy insurance
- Mitigation → Decrease the risk

# Risk Analysis
## Risk register
Identify and document the risk associated with each step
Apply possible solutions to the identified risks
Monitor the results

## Risk matrix / risk heat map
View the results of the risk assesment
Visually identify risk based on color
Combines the likelihood of an event with the potential impact
Assists with making strategic decisions

## Audit risk model
- Inherent risk 
	Impact + likelihood
	Risk that exist in the absence of controls
- Residual risk
	Inherent risk + control effectiveness
	Risk that exists after controls are considered
- Risk appetite
	The amount of risk an organization is willing to take

## Regulations that affect risk posture
- HIPPA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
	Privacy of patient records
- GDPR 
	Personal data must be protected

## Qualitative risk assesment
Identify significant risk factors 
- Ask opinions about the significance
- Display visually with traffic light grid or similar method
# Quantitative risk assesment
Annualize Rate of Occurence (ARO)
- SLE (Single Loss Expectancy)
	What is the monetary loss if a single event occurs
- ALE (Annualize Loss Expectancy)
	ARO X SLE
- Quantitative vs qualitative

## Disaster types
- Environmental threats
- Person-made threats
- Internal and external

# Business Impact Analysis
- RTO (Recovery Time Objective)
	Get back to a particular service level
- RPO (Recovery point objective)
	Bring the system back online, how far back does data go?
- Mean time to repair (MTTR) → How much time to fix
- Mean time between failures (MTBF)→ Predict the time between failures

## Functional recovery plans

- Reputation
# Privacy and Data Breaches

## Information life cycle

## Consequences
Reputation damage
Identity theft
Fines
IP theft
## Notification
- Internal escalation process
- External escalation process
- Public notifications and disclosures

## Notices
- Terms of service
- Privacy notice, privacy policy

# Data classifications

- Customer data → Legal handling requirements


# Enchancing Privacy
- Tokenization
- Data minimization
- Data masking
- Anonymization → Make it impossible to identify individual data from a dataset, cannot be reversed
- Pseudo-anonymization → Replace personal information with pseudonyms, can be reversible
