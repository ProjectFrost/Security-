# Reviewing a few concepts with Chat-GPT

# Continous integration/continous delivery pipeline
1. **General Overview:** The CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) pipeline is a set of automated processes that facilitate the development, testing, and deployment of software changes. Continuous Integration involves regularly merging code changes from different contributors into a shared repository, followed by automated build and testing. Continuous Delivery extends this by automating the release process, ensuring that software changes are always in a deployable state. The ultimate goal is to provide a more efficient and reliable software development and deployment cycle.

# Risk transference
- Risk Transference is a risk management strategy in which an organization shifts the financial burden or accountability of a risk to a third party. This is typically done through mechanisms like insurance, outsourcing, or contractual agreements. By transferring the risk, the organization aims to mitigate the potential financial impact and share the responsibility for managing and addressing the risk.
    
- **What You Might Need to Know for the Security+ Exam:**
    
    - **Risk Management Strategies:** Recognize risk transference as one of the key risk management strategies, alongside risk avoidance, risk mitigation, and risk acceptance.
