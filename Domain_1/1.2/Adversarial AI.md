A rapidly developing field targeting [[AI]] and [[ML]]

# Tainted training data for machine learning (ML)
**Data poisoning** that supplies AI and ML algorithms with adversarial data that serves the attackers purposes, or attacks against privacy. 

# Security of machine learning algorithms 
- Validate quality and security of the **data sources**.
- Secure **infrastructure and environment** where AI and ML is hosted. 
- Review, test, and document **changes** to AI and ML algorithms
