In [probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory "Probability theory"), the **birthday problem** asks for the probability that, in a set of n [randomly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random "Random") chosen people, at least two will share a [birthday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday "Birthday"). The **birthday paradox** refers to the counterintuitive fact that only 23 people are needed for that probability to exceed 50%.
