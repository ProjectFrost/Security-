# Cloud VS On Premises Attacks
## Cloud Based Attacks
Data center is often **more secure** and **less vulnerable** to disruptive attacks.. You will not have facility-level or physical system-level **audit access**
**Changes (and limits) the attacks you worry about**
## On-Premises Attacks
You **do not benefit** from the cloudÂ´s **shared responsibility model**. You have more control but are reponsible for security of the **full stack**
**Org has to defend a wider range of attacks and greater expense and effort to defend against them**
