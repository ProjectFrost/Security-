Putting too much information into too small of a space that has been set aside for numbers


When the result of an integer operation **does not fit within the allocated memory space**
Usually causes the program to behave on an unexpected way.

Often leads to [[Buffer Overflow]] 

**Error messages may include “overflow” or “arithmetic overflow”**

BEST DEFENSE → Good coding practices, appropiate typing of variables, **using larger variable types**
