Drones are used by flying over target locations to identify and assess wireless networks, vulnerabilities, and physical security measures.


Drones pose security risks through unauthorized surveillance, potential weaponization, and airspace intrusion, requiring regulation and countermeasures to mitigate privacy and safety concerns.


Drones enhance physical security with surveillance, monitoring, and rapid response capabilities, providing real-time situational awareness and improving overall threat detection and assessment.
