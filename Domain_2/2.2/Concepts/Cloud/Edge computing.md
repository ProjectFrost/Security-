Edge computing is a subdivision of [[Fog computing]]

The most important concepts about it are:

1. **Decentralized Processing:**
    
    - Shifts data processing closer to the source, reducing latency and improving response times by performing computations at the edge of the network.
2. **IoT Integration:**
    
    - Seamlessly integrates with the Internet of Things (IoT), enabling efficient handling of vast amounts of data generated by connected devices.
3. **Bandwidth Optimization:**
    
    - Minimizes the need for transmitting large volumes of data to centralized cloud servers, optimizing bandwidth usage and reducing network congestion.
4. **Real-time Processing:**
    
    - Enables real-time data analysis and decision-making at or near the data source, crucial for applications requiring low latency, such as autonomous vehicles and industrial automation.
5. **Distributed Architecture:**
    
    - Utilizes a distributed architecture with computing resources deployed at various network edges, enhancing scalability, reliability, and fault tolerance.
6. **Security Enhancement:**
    
    - Improves security by processing sensitive data locally, reducing the attack surface and potential vulnerabilities associated with transmitting data over long distances.
7. **Context-aware Applications:**
    
    - Facilitates context-aware applications that leverage local data and insights, enhancing user experiences and supporting personalized services.
8. **Cloud Integration:**
    
    - Complements cloud computing by offloading certain processing tasks to the edge, creating a hybrid architecture that combines the strengths of both cloud and edge computing.
9. **Use Case Diversity:**
    
    - Applicable across various industries, including healthcare, manufacturing, smart cities, and retail, offering tailored solutions for specific business needs.
10. **Edge Devices:**
    
    - Employs edge devices like routers, gateways, and IoT devices as computing nodes, forming a distributed computing network at the edge of the infrastructure.
11. **Autonomous Operations:**
    
    - Supports autonomous operations by enabling devices to make decisions locally without relying on constant communication with centralized servers.
12. **Data Privacy Compliance:**
    
    - Addresses data privacy concerns by keeping sensitive information localized, aligning with regulations and ensuring compliance with privacy standards.
13. **Resource Efficiency:**
    
    - Optimizes resource utilization by distributing computing tasks across edge devices, reducing the strain on centralized data centers and improving overall system efficiency.
14. **Adaptability to Network Conditions:**
    
    - Adapts to varying network conditions and intermittent connectivity, making it suitable for environments with limited or unreliable network access.
15. **Emerging Technologies:**
    
    - Supports emerging technologies like 5G, enabling high-speed, low-latency communication, and fostering the development of innovative applications and services.
