1. **Isolation:** Containers encapsulate applications, ensuring isolation and preventing conflicts by bundling dependencies and libraries within a contained environment.
    
2. **Lightweight:** Containers share the host OS kernel, reducing overhead and resource consumption compared to virtual machines.
    
3. **Portability:** Containers are platform-independent, easily movable between different environments, promoting consistency and scalability across development, testing, and production.
    
4. **Orchestration:** Tools like Kubernetes automate container deployment, scaling, and management, simplifying the orchestration of containerized applications in a distributed environment.
    
5. **Microservices Architecture:** Containers align with [[Microservices - API|microservices]], enabling the development and deployment of modular, independently deployable services for flexibility and agility.
    
6. **Immutable Infrastructure:** Containers promote an immutable infrastructure model, where the deployment environment is consistent and reproducible, enhancing reliability and ease of management.
    
7. **Docker:** Widely used containerization platform with a vast ecosystem, allowing developers to build, ship, and run applications consistently across various environments.
    
8. **Images and Registries:** Containers are built from images, and container registries store and distribute these images, facilitating version control, sharing, and collaboration.
    
9. **Security Considerations:** Container security involves image scanning, runtime protection, and securing orchestration platforms to address vulnerabilities and protect against threats.
    
10. **DevOps Integration:** Containers facilitate DevOps practices by streamlining collaboration between development and operations teams, fostering a [[Continous Integration|continuous integration]] and [[Continous Deployment|continuous deployment]] (CI/CD) pipeline.
    
11. **Resource Efficiency:** Containers optimize resource utilization, enabling efficient use of infrastructure and reducing the environmental impact of applications.
    
12. **Statelessness:** Containers are designed to be stateless, with data persistence managed separately. This enhances scalability and resilience in dynamic and distributed computing environments.
