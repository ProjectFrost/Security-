SDN stands for Software Defined Network and his most important concepts are:

1. **Centralized Control:** SDN separates control and data planes, enabling centralized network management.
2. **Programmability:** Networks become programmable, adaptable to changing requirements.
3. **OpenFlow Protocol:** Standardized communication between the control and data planes.
4. **Virtualization:** Allows network abstraction, creating virtualized environments.
5. **Automation:** Enhances efficiency through automated configuration and management.
6. **Flexibility:** Easily scales and adjusts to network changes.
7. **Network Intelligence:** Enhanced analytics for informed decision-making.
8. **Dynamic Traffic Management:** Efficiently directs and optimizes network traffic.
9. **Cost Savings:** Reduces hardware dependency and operational costs.
10. **Innovation:** Facilitates innovation in network architecture and services.
