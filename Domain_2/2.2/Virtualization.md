Virtualization is the creation of virtual instances of computing resources, including servers, storage, and networks, enabling efficient resource utilization, scalability, and flexibility in IT infrastructure. Key concepts include:

1. **Hypervisor:**
    
    - Software that creates and manages virtual machines (VMs), allowing multiple operating systems to run on a single physical host.
2. **Virtual Machine (VM):**
    
    - An isolated software-based representation of a physical computer, enabling multiple operating systems to run on a single physical machine.
3. **Resource Pooling:**
    
    - Centralized management of computing resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage, shared among virtual machines to optimize efficiency.
4. **Snapshot:**
    
    - A point-in-time image of a virtual machine's state, allowing for easy backup, recovery, and testing.
5. **Live Migration:**
    
    - Seamless relocation of a running VM from one physical host to another, ensuring continuous availability during maintenance or resource optimization.
6. **Cloning:**
    
    - Replicating existing VMs to create identical copies for testing, deployment, or backup purposes.
7. **Elasticity:**
    
    - Dynamic allocation and deallocation of resources based on demand, providing scalability and flexibility in adapting to changing workloads.
8. **Type 1 and Type 2 Hypervisors:**
    
    - Type 1 (bare-metal) runs directly on hardware, while Type 2 (hosted) runs on top of an operating system. Both facilitate virtualization but differ in architecture.
9. **Network Virtualization:**
    
    - Abstracting and pooling network resources to create virtual networks, improving flexibility and efficiency in managing network infrastructure.
10. **Storage Virtualization:**
    
    - Abstracting physical storage resources to create a virtualized storage pool, simplifying management and improving utilization.
11. **Hypervisor Security:**
    
    - Ensuring the security of the hypervisor to prevent unauthorized access and protect the integrity of virtualized environments.
12. **DevOps and Cloud Computing:**
    
    - Virtualization is foundational to DevOps practices and cloud computing, providing agility, scalability, and automation in modern IT infrastructures.
13. **Containers:**
    
    - Lightweight, portable, and efficient alternatives to VMs, enabling the deployment of applications and services with reduced overhead.
14. **Overcommitting:**
    
    - Allocating more virtual resources than physically available, leveraging the assumption that not all VMs will require their maximum allocated resources simultaneously.
