Continuous Delivery (CD) in automation/scripting is a software development approach aiming for efficient and reliable deployment. Key concepts include:

1. **Automation:**
    
    - Implementing automated scripts and tools to streamline the entire software delivery pipeline, from development to deployment.
2. **[[Continous integration]] (CI):**
    
    - Frequent integration of code changes into a shared repository, followed by automated testing, ensuring early detection of issues.
3. **Version Control:**
    
    - Using version control systems like Git to manage code changes systematically and enabling collaboration among development teams.
4. **Automated Testing:**
    
    - Implementing automated testing at various levels (unit, integration, and acceptance) to validate code changes and maintain software quality.
5. **Deployment Automation:**
    
    - Employing automated deployment scripts to consistently and reliably move applications through development, testing, and production environments.
6. **Infrastructure as Code ([[IaC]]):**
    
    - Defining and managing infrastructure through code, enabling automated provisioning and configuration of resources in a consistent manner.
7. **Collaboration:**
    
    - Encouraging collaboration among development, operations, and quality assurance teams to facilitate a smooth and efficient delivery process.
8. **Feedback Loops:**
    
    - Establishing feedback loops for continuous improvement, enabling teams to learn from each deployment and enhance the development process.
9. **Microservices Architecture:**
    
    - Utilizing a [[Microservices]] architecture that allows for independent deployment and scaling of individual components, contributing to CD principles.
10. **Monitoring and Logging:**
    
    - Integrating monitoring and logging tools to track application performance, detect issues, and gather insights for continuous improvement.
11. **Security Integration:**
    
    - Integrating security practices throughout the delivery pipeline, including code analysis, vulnerability scanning, and compliance checks.
12. **Environment Consistency:**
    
    - Ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production environments to minimize deployment-related issues.
13. **Rollback Mechanism:**
    
    - Implementing automated rollback mechanisms to quickly revert to a previous version in case of deployment issues.
14. **Continuous Documentation:**
    
    - Maintaining up-to-date documentation for scripts, configurations, and deployment processes to ensure transparency and knowledge sharing.

Continuous Delivery in automation/scripting is about building a reliable, automated pipeline that enables frequent and consistent software releases while maintaining a high level of quality and efficiency.
