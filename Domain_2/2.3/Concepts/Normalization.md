Normalization in secure coding techniques involves standardizing and validating input to prevent vulnerabilities. Key concepts include:

1. **Input Validation:**
    
    - Verify and sanitize input data to prevent injection attacks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
2. **Avoidance of Code Injection:**
    
    - Ensure that user input is properly validated and sanitized to prevent malicious code injection into the application.
3. **Preventing Buffer Overflows:**
    
    - Use proper string handling techniques to prevent buffer overflows, a common vulnerability exploited by attackers.
4. **Data Integrity:**
    
    - Maintain data integrity by enforcing consistency and preventing unexpected alterations or manipulations of data.
5. **Security Controls:**
    
    - Implement security controls to validate and sanitize user inputs based on predefined criteria and acceptable patterns.
6. **Least Privilege Principle:**
    
    - Apply the principle of least privilege to ensure that users and processes have only the minimum necessary access rights.
7. **Parameterized Queries:**
    
    - Use parameterized queries in database interactions to prevent SQL injection by separating data from SQL commands.
8. **Web Application Firewalls (WAF):**
    
    - Employ WAFs to filter and monitor HTTP traffic between a web application and the Internet, detecting and blocking malicious activities.
9. **Session Management:**
    
    - Implement secure session management practices to protect against session-related vulnerabilities and unauthorized access.
10. **Validation of File Uploads:**
    
    - Validate file uploads rigorously, checking file types, size limits, and ensuring proper handling to prevent security risks.
11. **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):**
    
    - Implement CORS policies to control how web pages in one domain can request and interact with resources in another domain.
12. **Secure Configuration:**
    
    - Configure application servers, databases, and other components securely, following best practices to minimize potential vulnerabilities.
13. **Logging and Monitoring:**
    
    - Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring mechanisms to detect and respond to security incidents promptly.
14. **Secure Error Handling:**
    
    - Design error handling mechanisms that provide minimal information to users and log detailed error messages securely.

Normalization in secure coding is foundational for building robust, resilient, and secure software systems by addressing common vulnerabilities and ensuring a strong defense against potential threats.
