AAA, which stands for Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting, is a framework essential for access control and security in computer systems. Key concepts include:

1. **Authentication:**
    
    - Verifying the identity of users or entities attempting to access a system through methods like passwords, biometrics, or multi-factor authentication.
2. **Authorization:**
    
    - Granting or denying access rights and permissions to authenticated users based on their roles, privileges, or other attributes.
3. **Accounting:**
    
    - Tracking and logging user activities, providing an audit trail for security monitoring, compliance, and troubleshooting.
4. **Centralized Management:**
    
    - AAA facilitates centralized management of user identities, access policies, and auditing across network devices and applications.
5. **Single Sign-On ([[SSO]]):**
    
    - Allowing users to authenticate once and access multiple systems without re-authenticating, enhancing user convenience and security.
6. **Role-Based Access Control ([[RBAC]]):**
    
    - Assigning permissions based on user roles, streamlining access management and reducing complexity.
7. **Attributes and Policies:**
    
    - Defining access rules and policies based on user attributes, ensuring fine-grained control over resource access.
8. **Authentication Protocols:**
    
    - Using protocols such as [[RADIUS]], [[TACACS+]], and [[OAuth]] to facilitate secure authentication processes.
9. **Least Privilege Principle:**
    
    - Granting users the minimum level of access required for their roles or tasks, minimizing potential security risks.
10. **Session Management:**
    
    - Controlling and monitoring user sessions, including establishing, maintaining, and terminating sessions securely.
11. **Accountability:**
    
    - Holding users accountable for their actions through detailed logging and auditing, aiding in forensic analysis and compliance.
12. **Dynamic Provisioning:**
    
    - Adapting access permissions in real-time based on changes in user roles, responsibilities, or other contextual factors.
