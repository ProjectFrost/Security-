Attestation is an authentication method ensuring the integrity and authenticity of system components. Key concepts include:

1. **Integrity Verification:**
    
    - Ensuring the integrity of hardware, firmware, or software components by verifying their authenticity and unaltered state.
2. **[[Root of Trust]]:**
    
    - Establishing a secure foundation, often in hardware, that can be trusted as the starting point for verifying the integrity of the system.
3. **Measuring Components:**
    
    - Taking cryptographic measurements of system components, creating a unique signature based on their state.
4. **Remote Attestation:**
    
    - Verifying the integrity of a remote system component, allowing parties to assess its trustworthiness without direct access.
5. **[[Secure Boot]]:**
    
    - Ensuring that the boot process only loads signed and authorized components, preventing the execution of malicious code during startup.
6. **Platform Attestation:**
    
    - Confirming the integrity of an entire computing platform, including hardware and software components.
7. **Continuous Monitoring:**
    
    - Regularly assessing and attesting the system's integrity to detect and respond to potential compromise or unauthorized changes.
8. **Attestation Challenges:**
    
    - Addressing challenges such as protecting the attestation process from tampering and securing communication channels between components.
9. **Standards and Protocols:**
    
    - Following industry standards and protocols, such as TPM (Trusted Platform Module) and UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface), to implement attestation securely.
10. **Zero Trust Security Model:**
    
    - Integrating attestation into the broader context of a Zero Trust model, where trust is never assumed, and verification is continuous.
