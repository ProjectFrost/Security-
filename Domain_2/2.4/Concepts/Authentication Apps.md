Authentication apps, a form of multi-factor authentication (MFA), enhance security by generating time-sensitive codes. Key concepts include:

1. **Time-Sensitive Codes:**
    
    - Authentication apps generate unique codes that expire quickly, adding an extra layer of security beyond passwords.
2. **Multi-Factor Authentication ([[MFA]]):**
    
    - Requires users to provide multiple forms of identification, typically combining a password with a time-sensitive code from the app.
3. **Two-Factor Authentication ([[2FA]]):**
    
    - Combining traditional password authentication with a code from the authentication app for enhanced security.
4. **Offline Authenticator Apps:**
    
    - Codes are generated offline, reducing dependency on internet connectivity and minimizing certain attack vectors.
5. **Device Independence:**
    
    - Authenticator apps are often device-independent, allowing users to use different devices for code generation.
6. **Secret Key Provisioning:**
    
    - During initial setup, a secret key is securely exchanged between the app and the authentication system.
7. **Security Tokens:**
    
    - The secret key acts as a security token, ensuring that only authorized users with the app can generate valid authentication codes.
8. **Phishing Resistance:**
    
    - Authentication apps are resistant to phishing attacks as the generated codes are time-sensitive and tied to the specific user's device.
9. **Enhanced Security:**
    
    - Provides an additional layer of security beyond passwords, making it more challenging for unauthorized users to gain access.
10. **Integration with Identity Providers:**
    
    - Many authentication apps integrate with identity providers and services, offering a seamless and standardized MFA experience.
