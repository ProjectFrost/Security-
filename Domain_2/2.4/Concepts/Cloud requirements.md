1. **Identity as a Service (IDaaS):**
    
    - Cloud solutions often leverage IDaaS for centralized identity management, offering scalable and flexible authentication services.
2. **Single Sign-On (SSO):**
    
    - SSO streamlines user access across multiple cloud services with a single set of credentials, enhancing user experience.
3. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
    
    - Cloud emphasizes MFA for enhanced security, combining multiple authentication methods to verify user identity.
4. **API Security:**
    
    - Cloud requires robust API security for secure communication between cloud services and authentication providers.
5. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
    
    - RBAC is crucial for cloud authorization, allowing administrators to define and manage user access based on roles and responsibilities.
6. **Scalability:**
    
    - Cloud authentication and authorization systems are designed for scalability, accommodating dynamic workloads and user bases.
7. **Federated Identity Management:**
    
    - Cloud often employs federated identity to enable seamless and secure access across multiple services and platforms.
