Efficacy rates in biometrics measure the accuracy and reliability of authentication methods. Key concepts include:

1. **False Acceptance Rate ([[FAR]]):**
    
    - Percentage of unauthorized users accepted as legitimate, indicating the system's vulnerability to impostors.
2. **False Rejection Rate ([[FRR]]):**
    
    - Percentage of legitimate users rejected, indicating the system's likelihood to deny access to authorized individuals.
3. **Equal Error Rate (EER):**
    
    - Point where FAR and FRR are equal, providing a balanced measure of system accuracy.
4. **Failure to Enroll Rate (FTE):**
    
    - Rate at which users are unable to enroll successfully, affecting the system's overall performance.
5. **Crossover Error Rate ([[CER]]):**
    
    - Another term for the Equal Error Rate, representing the point where FAR and FRR intersect.
6. **True Positive (TP) and True Negative (TN):**
    
    - Correctly identifying legitimate users and rejecting unauthorized ones, contributing to system efficacy.
7. **Biometric Accuracy Trade-offs:**
    
    - Adjusting system parameters may impact FAR and FRR differently, requiring a balance based on security and usability needs.
8. **Template Aging:**
    
    - Consideration of the degradation of biometric templates over time, affecting the accuracy of matching.
9. **Spoofing and Presentation Attacks:**
    
    - Evaluation of the system's vulnerability to attempts to deceive it with fake biometric data.
10. **Multimodal Biometrics:**
    
    - Using multiple biometric factors to enhance accuracy and address limitations associated with a single biometric trait.
