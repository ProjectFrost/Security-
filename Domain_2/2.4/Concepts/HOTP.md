HOTP (HMAC-based One-Time Password) is an authentication technology with key concepts including:

1. **One-Time Passwords (OTPs):**
    
    - Unique passwords generated for a single authentication session, enhancing security compared to static passwords.
2. **HMAC Algorithm:**
    
    - Use of the HMAC (Hash-Based Message Authentication Code) algorithm to generate OTPs, providing cryptographic security.
3. **Shared Secret:**
    
    - A secret key shared between the authentication server and the client device for OTP generation.
4. **Counter-Based Generation:**
    
    - OTPs are generated based on a counter value shared between the server and client, ensuring synchronization.
5. **Time Sensitivity:**
    
    - OTPs may be time-based, expiring after a predefined period, adding an additional layer of security.
6. **Secure Communication:**
    
    - Secure transmission of OTPs between the client and server to prevent interception or replay attacks.
7. **Resynchronization:**
    
    - Mechanism for resynchronizing the counter if it deviates between the client and server due to issues like loss of OTPs.
8. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**
    
    - HOTP is commonly used as part of two-factor authentication, requiring both a static password and a dynamic OTP for access.
9. **Standardization:**
    
    - Compliance with standards like RFC 4226, ensuring interoperability and compatibility across different systems.
10. **Protection Against Credential Theft:**
    
    - Mitigation against risks associated with stolen or compromised static passwords, as OTPs are valid for a single use or a short time.
