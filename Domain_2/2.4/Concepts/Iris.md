Key concepts about the use of iris in biometrics include:

1. **Unique Identification:**
    
    - The iris has unique patterns that can be used for highly accurate individual identification.
2. **Biometric Template:**
    
    - Iris scans create a biometric template, a digital representation of distinctive features used for comparison.
3. **Non-Intrusive:**
    
    - Iris recognition is non-intrusive, requiring only a simple scan without physical contact.
4. **Uniqueness and Stability:**
    
    - The iris is both unique to individuals and stable over time, making it a reliable biometric identifier.
5. **Authentication and Identification:**
    
    - Iris biometrics is used for both user authentication (confirming identity) and identification (finding identity within a database).
6. **High Accuracy:**
    
    - Iris recognition systems provide high accuracy due to the distinctiveness of iris patterns.
7. **Illumination Independence:**
    
    - Iris scans are less affected by changes in lighting conditions, making them robust across various environments.
8. **Contactless Access Control:**
    
    - Iris-based systems are often used in access control for secure and convenient entry without physical contact.
9. **Privacy Considerations:**
    
    - Ensuring privacy is crucial; iris templates should be securely stored, and concerns about surveillance and misuse must be addressed.
10. **Enrollment Process:**
    
    - Users undergo an enrollment process where the system captures and stores the iris template for future comparison.
11. **Multimodal Biometrics:**
    
    - Combining iris recognition with other biometric methods enhances overall security and reduces false positives.
