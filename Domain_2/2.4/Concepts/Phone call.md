Phone calls as an authentication technology involve:

1. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**
    
    - Verifying identity by combining a password with a phone call or code for added security.
2. **Voice Biometrics:**
    
    - Using voice patterns for identification, adding a layer of authentication beyond traditional methods.
3. **One-Time Passcodes ([[OTP|OTPs]]):**
    
    - Delivering unique codes via phone calls for single-use authentication, enhancing security.
4. **Call-back Verification:**
    
    - Authenticating users by initiating a call-back to a pre-registered phone number.
5. **Out-of-Band Authentication:**
    
    - Verifying identity through a separate communication channel (phone) to reduce the risk of compromise.
6. **SMS vs. Voice Calls:**
    
    - Comparing the security and vulnerabilities of authentication via SMS messages versus voice calls.
7. **Phishing Mitigation:**
    
    - Implementing phone-based authentication to mitigate phishing risks associated with traditional login methods.
8. **Mobile Device Verification:**
    
    - Verifying a user's identity by confirming their access to a registered mobile device through a phone call.
9. **User Experience:**
    
    - Balancing security with user convenience to ensure a positive authentication experience.
10. **Fallback Mechanisms:**
    
    - Establishing alternative methods in case phone-based authentication is not feasible.
11. **Regulatory Compliance:**
    
    - Adhering to data protection regulations and industry standards when implementing phone-based authentication.
12. **Fraud Prevention:**
    
    - Monitoring and addressing potential fraud risks associated with phone-based authentication methods.
