Smart cards are secure authentication tools with key concepts:

1. **Integrated Circuit:** Contains a microprocessor or memory chip for secure data storage and processing.
    
2. **Authentication [[Token]]:** Generates unique codes or responses, enhancing user authentication.
    
3. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Combines something the user knows (PIN) with something they possess (smart card) for stronger security.
    
4. **Public Key Infrastructure ([[PKI]]):** Utilizes asymmetric cryptography for secure communication and data protection.
    
5. **Contact and Contactless Cards:** Contact cards require physical insertion, while contactless cards use radio frequency for proximity-based authentication.
    
6. **Secure Element:** Provides isolated and secure storage for sensitive information, preventing unauthorized access.
    
7. **[[Biometrics|Biometric]] Integration:** Enhances security by combining smart card authentication with biometric verification.
    
8. **Multi-Application Support:** Capable of storing multiple applications, such as access control, payments, and identification.
    
9. **Physical Security:** Resistant to tampering, adding a layer of physical security to authentication.
    
10. **Common Access Card (CAC) and Personal Identity Verification (PIV):** Examples of government-issued smart cards used for secure access.
