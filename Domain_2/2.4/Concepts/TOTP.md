Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) is an authentication technology with key concepts:

1. **Dynamic Codes:**
    
    - TOTP generates time-sensitive, dynamic codes that change at regular intervals for secure user authentication.
2. **Shared Secret Key:**
    
    - Users and the authentication server share a secret key used to generate and validate TOTP codes.
3. **Time Synchronization:**
    
    - The user's device and the authentication server must be synchronized to ensure accurate code generation.
4. **Algorithm:**
    
    - HMAC-based algorithms (e.g., HMAC-SHA1) are commonly used to generate TOTP codes securely.
5. **Standardization:**
    
    - TOTP is standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in RFC 6238 for consistency and interoperability.
6. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**
    
    - TOTP is often used as a second factor in two-factor authentication, enhancing security.
7. **Authentication Apps:**
    
    - Authenticator apps on mobile devices (e.g., Google Authenticator) commonly implement TOTP for generating codes.
8. **Offline Authentication:**
    
    - TOTP allows offline authentication without relying on a network connection once the initial key is shared.
9. **Expiry Window:**
    
    - TOTP codes have a short validity window (usually 30 seconds), enhancing security by limiting the time an intercepted code is usable.
10. **Security Benefits:**
    
    - TOTP provides increased security compared to static passwords, offering protection against various cyber threats.
