Token keys play a crucial role in authentication technology:

1. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**
    
    - Token keys often serve as the second factor, enhancing security by requiring something the user knows (password) and something the user has (token key).
2. **Time-Based One-Time Passwords ([[TOTP]]):**
    
    - Token keys generate time-sensitive codes, adding an element of dynamic authentication that changes at regular intervals for enhanced security.
3. **HMAC-Based One-Time Passwords ([[HOTP]]):**
    
    - Utilizing cryptographic algorithms, HOTP generates one-time passwords based on a counter, ensuring uniqueness for each authentication attempt.
4. **Hardware Tokens and Smart Cards:**
    
    - Token keys can be stored on hardware devices or [[Smart card|smart cards]], providing a physical form of authentication that is less susceptible to certain types of attacks.
5. **Mobile Authenticator [[Authentication Apps|Apps]]:**
    
    - Many token keys are implemented through mobile apps, offering convenient and portable 2FA solutions.
6. **Public and Private Key Pairs:**
    
    - Token keys may involve asymmetric cryptography, with a public key shared openly and a private key held securely by the user or system.
7. **Biometric Integration:**
    
    - Token keys can be combined with biometric authentication for multi-modal security, offering both something the user possesses and something inherent to the user.
8. **Revocation and Expiry:**
    
    - Token keys can be revoked if compromised, and they often have an expiration period, minimizing the risk associated with lost or stolen tokens.
9. **Authentication Protocols:**
    
    - Token-based authentication often follows standardized protocols like OAuth, ensuring interoperability and security in various systems.
10. **Identity [[Federation]]:**
    
    - Token-based authentication facilitates identity federation, allowing users to access multiple systems with a single set of credentials.
