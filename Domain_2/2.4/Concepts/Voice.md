Voice biometrics uses voiceprints for identification or authentication. Key concepts include:

1. **Voiceprint Creation:**
    
    - Unique vocal characteristics like pitch and tone form a voiceprint, used to identify individuals.
2. **Authentication:**
    
    - Verifying identity by matching the voiceprint with a pre-enrolled sample during authentication processes.
3. **Enrollment:**
    
    - Capturing and storing an individual's voiceprint in a biometric system for future reference.
4. **Dynamic vs. Static Features:**
    
    - Dynamic features involve patterns influenced by emotions, stress, etc., while static features are inherent voice characteristics.
5. **Anti-Spoofing Measures:**
    
    - Implementing safeguards to prevent voice impersonation or spoofing attacks.
6. **Text-Dependent vs. Text-Independent:**
    
    - Text-dependent systems require specific phrases, while text-independent systems analyze speech patterns without predefined phrases.
7. **Continuous Authentication:**
    
    - Monitoring and authenticating users continuously during interactions, enhancing security.
8. **Multimodal Biometrics:**
    
    - Integrating voice recognition with other biometric methods for more robust authentication.
9. **Vulnerabilities:**
    
    - Consideration of potential vulnerabilities, such as background noise or changes in the user's health affecting voice characteristics.
10. **Privacy Concerns:**
    
    - Addressing privacy issues related to the collection and storage of voice biometric data.
