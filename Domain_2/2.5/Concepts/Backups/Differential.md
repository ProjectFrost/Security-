A differential backup is a type of backup that captures only the data that has changed since the last full backup. Unlike incremental backups, which only store changes since the last backup (whether it's a full or incremental backup), a differential backup accumulates changes made since the last full backup. Each differential backup includes all changes since the full backup, making it easier and faster to restore data compared to incremental backups, especially when multiple incremental backups are involved.
