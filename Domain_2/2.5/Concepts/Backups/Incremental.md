An incremental backup is a type of backup strategy that only copies the data that has changed since the last backup, whether it's a full backup or a previous incremental backup. This approach is efficient in terms of storage space, as it only stores the changes made since the last backup, reducing the time and resources required for backup operations. However, restoring data from incremental backups may involve retrieving multiple incremental sets, starting from the last full or incremental backup.
