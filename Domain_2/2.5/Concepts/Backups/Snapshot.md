A snapshot is a point-in-time copy of the state of a system, typically a virtual machine (VM) or storage volume. It captures the data and configuration at that specific moment, allowing for easy restoration if needed. Snapshots are commonly used in virtualization environments, enabling quick recovery to a previous state without affecting the original data. It's important to note that while snapshots provide a convenient recovery option, they are not a substitute for regular backups, as they might not capture all necessary data for a complete restore.
