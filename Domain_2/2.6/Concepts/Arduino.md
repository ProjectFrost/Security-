Arduino is an open-source electronics platform. It consists of hardware (microcontrollers) and software, enabling users to create and program interactive electronic projects for various applications.

Arduino's security depends on project implementation. Secure coding practices are crucial to prevent unauthorized access and protect against vulnerabilities in IoT applications developed with Arduino.
