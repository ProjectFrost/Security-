Baseband radio refers to communication using digital signals without modulation. It transmits data over a single channel, common in wired and short-range wireless applications like Ethernet.

Baseband radio in embedded systems requires efficient modulation schemes, frequency planning, and interference mitigation for reliable communication, crucial in specialized applications such as IoT and industrial automation.
