MFP (Multi-Function Printer) integrates multiple office functions like printing, scanning, copying, and faxing into a single device, streamlining document management and workflow.

Multi-Function Printers (MFPs) pose security risks, as they store, transmit, and process sensitive documents. Unsecured MFPs can be exploited for unauthorized access and data breaches.
