Sensors are devices that detect and measure physical phenomena such as temperature, light, or motion, converting data into electrical signals for analysis and communication.

IoT sensors pose security risks, as they may be vulnerable to data interception, unauthorized access, and exploitation, potentially compromising user privacy and system integrity.
