VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) is a technology that enables voice communication over the internet, converting analog voice signals into digital data for transmission.

VoIP security concerns include eavesdropping, call interception, identity spoofing, and denial-of-service attacks, risking confidentiality, integrity, and availability of voice communication.
