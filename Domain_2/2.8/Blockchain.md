1. **Decentralized Ledger:**
    
    - Distributed and decentralized database that records transactions across a network of computers.
2. **Blocks:**
    
    - Data containers grouping transactions.
3. **Cryptographic Hash:**
    
    - Each block contains a unique identifier generated through cryptographic hashing.
4. **Consensus Mechanism:**
    
    - Agreement protocol among nodes to validate and add blocks, ensuring a shared and tamper-resistant history.
5. **Immutability:**
    
    - Once added, blocks are virtually impossible to alter due to cryptographic links and consensus.
6. **Smart Contracts:**
    
    - Self-executing contracts with predefined rules, automating and enforcing agreements.
7. **Transparency:**
    
    - All participants have visibility into the entire chain, promoting trust and accountability.
8. **Permissioned vs. Permissionless:**
    
    - Permissioned blockchains restrict participants, while permissionless allows open participation (e.g., Bitcoin).
9. **Use Cases:**
    
    - Beyond cryptocurrencies, blockchain finds applications in supply chain, finance, healthcare, and more.
10. **Challenges:**
    
    - Scalability, energy consumption, and regulatory concerns are challenges facing widespread blockchain adoption.
