    - ECC offers the same level of security as traditional systems with shorter key lengths, making it computationally efficient.
4. **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange:**
    
    - ECC supports secure key exchange, enabling parties to agree on a shared secret without transmitting the secret itself.
5. **[[Digital Signatures]]:**
    
    - ECC facilitates efficient digital signatures, providing authenticity and integrity verification in secure communication.
6. **Secured Communications:**
    
    - Commonly used in secure protocols like TLS, ECC ensures confidentiality and integrity in data transmission over networks.
7. **Resource Efficiency:**
    
    - ECC's computational efficiency is valuable for resource-constrained environments, such as mobile devices and [[IoT]] devices.
8. **Resistance to Quantum Attacks:**
    
    - ECC is considered quantum-resistant, offering a level of security against potential threats from quantum computers.
9. **Key Exchange in Public Key Cryptography:**
    
    - ECC plays a crucial role in public-key cryptography, allowing secure key exchange without pre-shared secrets.
10. **Widespread Adoption:**
    
    - ECC is increasingly adopted in cryptographic standards and protocols due to its efficiency, making it a cornerstone in modern encryption technologies.
