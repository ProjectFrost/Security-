1. **Concealment Method:**
    
    - Embedding secret data within an image without perceptible changes to the image's appearance.
2. **Carrier Image:**
    
    - The original image used to hide information, acting as a vessel for the concealed data.
3. **Payload:**
    
    - The hidden data, which can be text, images, or files, embedded within the carrier image.
4. **Bit Manipulation:**
    
    - Alters specific bits in the carrier image to encode the hidden information without altering the image visibly.
5. **Security Applications:**
    
    - Used for covert communication, watermarking, and protecting sensitive information by hiding it in plain sight.
6. **Detection Challenges:**
    
    - Difficult to detect without specialized tools, making steganalysis crucial for identifying hidden content.
7. **Various Techniques:**
    
    - Utilizes methods like LSB (Least Significant Bit) replacement, frequency domain techniques, and algorithmic approaches for embedding and extracting data.
8. **Risk and Defense:**
    
    - Raises concerns for data exfiltration but can be countered with regular steganalysis and security awareness.
