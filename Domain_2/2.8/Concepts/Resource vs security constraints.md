**Limitation of Resources:**

- In cryptography, concerns about computational power, storage, and bandwidth may limit the implementation of resource-intensive encryption algorithms, impacting system performance.

**Security Constraints:**

- Cryptographic systems must adhere to stringent security requirements, considering factors like key management, algorithm strength, and protection against attacks to ensure robust protection of sensitive information.
