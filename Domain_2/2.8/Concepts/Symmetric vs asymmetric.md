**Symmetric Encryption:**

- Uses a single key for both encryption and decryption.
- Faster and computationally less intensive.
- Key distribution challenge for secure communication.

**Asymmetric Encryption:**

- Involves a pair of public and private keys.
- Slower but facilitates secure key exchange.
- Enables [[Digital Signatures]] and secure communication without requiring a shared key.
