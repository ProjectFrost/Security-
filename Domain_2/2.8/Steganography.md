1. **Concealment Technique:**
    
    - Art of hiding information within other data (text, image, audio) to avoid detection, focusing on concealment rather than encryption.
2. **Carrier and Hidden Data:**
    
    - Carrier: Medium containing concealed data. Hidden Data: Information being concealed within the carrier.
3. **Invisibility:**
    
    - Goal is to make the hidden data undetectable to the human eye or other senses, ensuring secrecy.
4. **Techniques:**
    
    - Embedding in images, altering whitespace in text, manipulating audio frequencies—various methods conceal data based on the carrier medium.
5. **Cryptographic Steganography:**
    
    - Combining steganography with encryption for enhanced security, protecting both the hidden data and the fact that information is concealed.
6. **Digital and Analog Steganography:**
    
    - Digital: Concealing data in digital files. Analog: Embedding information in physical objects like microdots or invisible ink.
7. **Detection Challenges:**
    
    - Steganalysis aims to detect hidden data, but sophisticated techniques and encryption make steganography difficult to identify.
8. **Use Cases:**
    
    - Espionage, digital watermarking, covert communication—steganography finds applications in various fields for secure and discreet information transfer.
